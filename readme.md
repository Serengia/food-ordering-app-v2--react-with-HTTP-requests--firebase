# Food ordering app - v2 (React - with HTTP requests to Firebase)

This is a simple food ordering app featuring **advance cart**, **increment and decrement cart items options,** **pop-up modal with overlay, custom form hook, supports HTTP requests** (i.e. fetching and posting data to firebase) etc.

If you want to test it out, make sure you do the following for data fetching and posting to work, change the firebase links in the **Cart.js** and **AvailableMeals.js** components from **https://react-simple-food-app-default-xyz.firebaseio.com/meals.json** to your unique firebase realtime database link. Make sure to retain the **/meals.json** endpoint, ie **https://yourfirebaselink.com/meals.json**
